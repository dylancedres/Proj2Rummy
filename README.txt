README.txt file for Project 2: "Rummy, the Card Game of the Century!"


Extra Credit:
    (source file: Card.java/)

    - Used a different container of card images called "myCards/" that changed the 
    appearance of all the cards, taken from https://opengameart.org/content/playing-cards-vector-png .
    Also, changed the card Deck image to the logo of the Department of Computer Science 
    of our University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus, taken from the 
    Department's Facebook profile picture.


    - The game now starts with the first card from the Deck added to the Stack, instead of the game
     just starting with an empty Stack.



Implemented Classes: 
    (source file MyStack.java/)

    - public class MyStack{...}
        Creates a stack to use for hand operations.
        Based on the normal operations of a stack data structure (push, pop, peek, isEmpty, search).



Implemented Functions and Methods: 
    (source file Table.java/)

    - void layCard(Card card){...}
        Lays a card in one of the available spaces for sets or runs.
        Only modified some of the output string .

    
    - public String showHand(DefaultListModel playerHand) {...}
        Prints a Player's hand on the terminal


    - public void showAddedCard(Card card) {...}
        Prints the card from the DECK that was just added to the Player's hand


    - public void showDiscardedCard(Card card) {..}
	    Prints the card from the Player's hand that was just discarded to the STACK Pile


    - public void sortPlayerHand(DefaultListModel playerHand) {...}
        Sorts the Player's hand


    - public void showPlayersPoints(DefaultListModel player1Hand, DefaultListModel player2Hand) {...}
        Displays the points of the Players' Hands when the game is over 
        and displays which Player won the game


    - public void endGameOnEmptyHand(DefaultListModel player1Hand, DefaultListModel player2Hand) {...}
        Ends game if a Player's hand is empty (EMPTY HAND) and displays who won


    - public void endGameOnEmptyDeck(DefaultListModel player1Hand, DefaultListModel player2Hand) {...}
        Ends game if the Deck runs out of cards to play with (EMPTY DECK) and displays who won

        Used for new French gaming card images to implement 
        to the window of the actual Rummy game.


    - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/createpkgs.html

        Helped to understand how package creation and execution works
        and how to create them myself for this particular project.


    - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-class-in-java/

        Helped to understand how to create Stack objets in Java, how to 
        interact with them, and how to incorporate them in the Project at hand.


    - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/DefaultListModel.html#isEmpty()

        Helped to understand how Default List Models work and
        how they interact with other objects in Java.
        Also, it helped to see them as a bridge between
        data for the terminal and data for the window program.
